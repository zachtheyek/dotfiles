# TODO: delete iTerm2 artifacts and configs from device once Ghostty workflow matures

# FIX: 
# some bolded text looks weird when highlighted 
# e.g. TODOs in nvim, or current session in tmux statusline
# is it a Ghostty thing? or a catpuccin-mocha.conf thing?

# BUG: 
# weird escape codes in certain cases of pasting
# only happens in nvim, but not always
# specifically, yank (y) -> paste (p) works fine 
# but pasting with cmd+v results in weird escape codes
# NOTE: fixed in tmux.conf with set -s extended-keys off. monitor fix & delete comments when stable
# 
# Use standard bracketed paste, instead of CSI u-mode 
# Prevents unwanted escape sequences during paste (e.g. [27;5;106~)
